We develop, operate and maintain software for tournament organizers to create and manage competitions of skill in connection with online video games (“Client Games”) published by third parties (“Clients”).

          To the extent that we collect information on behalf of Clients as part of your interaction with the Client Games, our use of such information is governed by such Client’s privacy policies in addition to this Privacy Policy.  As such, if you interact with a Client Game, you should review the Client’s privacy policy regarding how that Client uses the information it collects or that we collect on its behalf.

        <h1>What Information Do We Collect About You and How Do We Use It?</h1>
        <h2>Types of Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Personal information means information that can be used to identify you, directly or indirectly.  The Site and GBarena Services may collect personal information from you including your email address, name, mailing address, phone number, geolocation, cookies, and in-game username.  We may also collect the same personal information from you for third parties as described below.
          Personal information is collected from you when you create an account on the Site; subscribe to our newsletter; participate in Site feedback, questionnaires, surveys, or contests; purchase a product through the Site; interact with Client Games; or receive customer or technical support.
          To create an account to use the GBarena Services, we will require you to provide certain information to create your account, including your name, password, and email address.
          If you sign up for one of the Client Games that interact with social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter, we may also collect personally identifiable information from these social networking sites and database services on behalf of ourselves and our Clients, including the Facebook Groups that you belong to. Those collects will be done with your consent.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Newsletters:</strong>
          GBarena may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send you commercial or marketing messages including, without limitation, newsletters, promotions, updates, special offers, and email communications about our products or services.  We will also use your email address to contact you regarding any customer or technical support issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payment Processing:</strong>
          If you purchase goods or services through the Site, GBarena may need for you to provide certain financial information so that GBarena may effect a payment transaction.  As part of the payment system, GBarena or third parties performing sales processing services on GBarena’s behalf, will collect, store and use non-public personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, credit card number, phone number, and your e-mail address.  In addition, the payment system will also collect information regarding the actual bill payment transaction, including the date and amount paid.  GBarena will store and protect this information in the same manner that it stores and protects other personal information.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Account Login:</strong>
          The personal information you provide will allow you to log in to the Site, Client Game, and GBarena Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Clients:</strong>
          We keep track of your interactions with us on behalf of our Clients, including but not limited to your activity within the Client Games and the GBarena Services. We may use personal information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the Client Games.  We may also use your personal information to contact you when necessary on behalf of our Clients.
        </p>

        <h2>De-Personalizing Your Information</h2>

        <p>We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable.  This process is known as de-personalizing your information.  You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your de-personalized information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect on the Site and GBarena Services (the “Analytical Data”).  We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties.
        </p>
        <h2>Cookies and other Technical Information</h2>
        <p>“Cookies” are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor’s browser and are stored on the visitor’s hard drive.  Like many websites, we employ cookies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information to make your online experience more convenient and to enhance your experience with the Site.  For example, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information so that the Site will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the Site by, for instance, tailoring content to you. Cookies also prevent items placed in a shopping basket from disappearing by the time you checkout.  Cookies are not spyware or adware, and can’t deliver viruses or run programs on your computer.  A user may configure his or her web browsers to accept or reject or delete the cookies, or notify the user when a cookie is being set.
          <br>
          We may collect other technical information from users of the Site, including their IP address, browser type, domain names and access times. We also may collect geolocational information, with the user’s consent.
        </p>
        <!--<h2>Web Beacons</h2>-->
        <!--<p>-->
        <!--We employ third party tracking utility software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  In short, clear gifs enable two websites to share information with one another.  We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.-->
        <!--</p>-->
        <h2>Tracking Pixel</h2>
        <p>A tracking “pixel” is a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page and allows for the collection of information regarding the use of the web page that contains the tracking pixel. The Company uses third party ad servers to support tracking pixels and cookies.
        </p>

        <h2>“Do Not Track”</h2>
        <p>In compliance with European legislation, especially the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), GBarena’s practices in responding to “do not track” signals and collecting user information over time and across a network of websites when you visit the Site are described below.  We honor the request of “do not track” signals sent by your browser when you visit the Site.  Additionally, GBarena does not collect user information about your online activities over time and across different websites, or authorize third parties to do so.</p>

        <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
        <p>Our Site uses Google Analytics to help us learn about who visits our site and what pages are being viewed. </p>

        <h2>Social Media Features</h2>
        <p>Our Site and certain Client Games interface with social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and others.  If you consent to log in to your account on the Site through those social media sites, then GBarena may access your information on those sites and import, use, and share your “friends” list or contacts from those sites.  If you choose to “like” or share personal information through those services, you should review the privacy policy of that service.  Those social media sites may collect your IP address or set cookies.  If you are a member of a social media site, the interfaces may allow the social media site to connect and view your personally identifiable information.</p>
